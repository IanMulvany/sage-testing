Now, social scientists can extract from large corpora actors and their relational networks on a vast scale, turning textual data into network data.","targetRectangle":{"y":-348.6927831172943,"x":305.0714416503906,"width":549.00537109375,"height":176.0000038146973}},{"text":"Price","targetRectangle":{"y":-63.03433179855347,"x":868.6329307556152,"width":38.7314453125,"height":22.00000047683716}},{"text":"Paid software","targetRectangle":{"y":-63.75537884235382,"x":557.7053298950195,"width":103.87,"height":21.47640274820333}},{"text":"From Berekley DLab · 907 citations · Last updated 31 Oct 2014","targetRectangle":{"y":485.1470339596272,"x":239.6827850341797,"width":419.40673828125,"height":19.80000042915344}},{"text":"Free","targetRectangle":{"y":229.9595946073532,"x":866.4091567993164,"width":43.17919921875,"height":27.50000059604645}},{"text":"pasted-image.png","targetRectangle":{"y":197.1939754486084,"x":96.39938020706177,"width":123.5702734325478,"height":94.53857793210591}},{"text":"Free","targetRectangle":{"y":590.9595946073532,"x":866.4091567993164,"width":43.17919921875,"height":27.50000059604645}},{"text":"Downloads","targetRectangle":{"y":-63.03433179855347,"x":736.1672325134277,"width":84.103515625,"height":22.00000047683716}},{"text":"✔","targetRectangle":{"y":-58.317626953125,"x":231.3197555541992,"width":8.4619140625,"height":10}},{"text":"204 citations · Last updated 31 Oct 2016","targetRectangle":{"y":123.6964419186115,"x":239.6827850341797,"width":269.35546875,"height":19.80000042915344}},{"text":"Jupiter notebooks","targetRectangle":{"y":381.4427367448807,"x":239.6827850341797,"width":190.6845703125,"height":28.60000061988831}},{"text":"A powerful and generic data and software exploration tool, it allows the creation of coding notebooks, creating server based collaborative spaces, and powerful visualisation tools, ","targetRectangle":{"y":410.042737364769,"x":239.6827850341797,"width":475.3359375,"height":66.00000143051147}},{"text":"✔","targetRectangle":{"y":-58.317626953125,"x":379.9863967895508,"width":8.4619140625,"height":10}},{"text":"✔","targetRectangle":{"y":-58.317626953125,"x":536.6530838012695,"width":8.4619140625,"height":10}},{"text":"2,501","targetRectangle":{"y":229.9595946073532,"x":751.9433670043945,"width":52.55126953125,"height":27.50000059604645}},{"text":"200","targetRectangle":{"y":590.9595946073532,"x":760.7002029418945,"width":35.03759765625,"height":27.50000059604645}},{"text":"2,501","targetRectangle":{"y":40.36187732219696,"x":751.9433670043945,"width":52.55126953125,"height":27.50000059604645}},{"text":"✔","targetRectangle":{"y":-58.317626953125,"x":116.6530838012695,"width":8.4619140625,"height":10}},{"text":"Free","targetRectangle":{"y":40.36187732219696,"x":866.4091567993164,"width":43.17919921875,"height":27.50000059604645}},{"text":"Screen Shot 2016-10-26 at 14.58.49.png","targetRectangle":{"y":12.79430198669434,"x":18.50244140625,"width":91.50001525878906,"height":34.5}},{"text":"Screen Shot 2016-10-26 at 14.58.49.png","targetRectangle":{"y":108.3836059570312,"x":123.7185363769531,"width":72.92418670654297,"height":27.49600028991699}},{"text":"Free","targetRectangle":{"y":768.9595946073532,"x":866.4091567993164,"width":43.17919921875,"height":27.50000059604645}},{"text":"ipython_-_Google_Search.png","targetRectangle":{"y":377.8498725891113,"x":103.3465118805567,"width":133.125,"height":69.34375}},{"text":"Log in","targetRectangle":{"y":18.99699592590332,"x":899.7246704995632,"width":44.93203103542328,"height":14}}],"baseLayer":{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"objectID":"0","layers":[{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,-0.0004922987690640373,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"layers":[{"animations":[],"layers":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"texture":"C0CD753315E29F465762E25F43A8EC9B"}]}]}}]}} )
